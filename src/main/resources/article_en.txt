Darknet: selling confidential information?
Information about leaks of confidential user information to the Darknet is increasingly emerging on the network.
But what is it, how does it work, and what can you do to save your data?
What is Darknet?
The Dark Web is the hidden part of the Internet. Translated from English, DarkNet literally means - shadow
or the dark web. It is only accessible through certain programs and tools that keep users anonymous and protect their personal information.
Participants on the Dark Web are called peers. The connection is made between them only in encrypted format
after mutual approval. The domains and address space on the Dark Web are also their own.
Even to get into the Darknet, you need special software. One of them is Tor Browser.
It encrypts the user's traffic while he is in contact with someone on the network. But when he enters or leaves it, it is quite possible to track him.
While the Dark Web is used for more than just disclosed activities, including
communication and information exchange, there are often cases of selling confidential information of users.
